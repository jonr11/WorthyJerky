    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>

    <img src="images/worthy_jerky1" alt="rasp" height="200" width="1000">

    <p>When I moved to Switzerland to finish my high school education, I asked my mother to send me her delicious home-made jerky so I could share a unique snack with my friends while we skied. No one could get enough. What began as a mother’s recipe has become a way of life for many who know nature provides the best ingredients. Now I’m working with an amazing team and we’ve reinvented jerky from the ground up by using the best steaks, fruits, vegetables and spices out there while sparing insert crappy things the competitor uses here. Nothing more, nothing less. The result? The most wholesome, nutritious snack Worthy of your body. Come try some!</p>
